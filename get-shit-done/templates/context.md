# Feature Context Template

Template for `.planning/features/{slug}/CONTEXT.md` - captures implementation decisions for a feature.

**Purpose:** Document decisions from the discussion step of `/gsd:next`. This ensures the user's vision is captured before planning and execution.

**Key principle:** Categories are NOT predefined. They emerge from what was actually discussed for THIS feature. A CLI feature has CLI-relevant sections, a UI feature has UI-relevant sections.

## File Template

```markdown
# [Feature Name] — Context

**Gathered:** [date]
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Feature Boundary

[Clear statement of what this feature delivers — the scope anchor. This comes from ROADMAP.md and is fixed. Discussion clarifies implementation within this boundary.]

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### [Area 1 that was discussed]
- [Specific decision made]
- [Another decision if applicable]

### [Area 2 that was discussed]
- [Specific decision made]

### [Area 3 that was discussed]
- [Specific decision made]

### Claude's Discretion
[Areas where user explicitly said "you decide" — Claude has flexibility here during planning/implementation]

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

[Any particular references, examples, or "I want it like X" moments from discussion. Product references, specific behaviors, interaction patterns.]

[If none: "No specific requirements — open to standard approaches"]

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

[Ideas that came up during discussion but belong in other features. Captured here so they're not lost, but explicitly out of scope for this feature.]

[If none: "None — discussion stayed within feature scope"]

<good_examples>

**Example 1: Visual feature (Post Feed)**

```markdown
# Post Feed — Context

**Gathered:** 2025-01-20
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Feature Boundary

Display posts from followed users in a scrollable feed. Users can view posts and see engagement counts. Creating posts and interactions are separate features.

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Layout style
- Card-based layout, not timeline or list
- Each card shows: author avatar, name, timestamp, full post content, reaction counts
- Cards have subtle shadows, rounded corners — modern feel

### Loading behavior
- Infinite scroll, not pagination
- Pull-to-refresh on mobile
- New posts indicator at top ("3 new posts") rather than auto-inserting

### Empty state
- Friendly illustration + "Follow people to see posts here"
- Suggest 3-5 accounts to follow based on interests

### Claude's Discretion
- Loading skeleton design
- Exact spacing and typography
- Error state handling

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "I like how Twitter shows the new posts indicator without disrupting your scroll position"
- Cards should feel like Linear's issue cards — clean, not cluttered

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Commenting on posts — separate feature
- Bookmarking posts — add to backlog

</deferred>

**Example 2: CLI tool (Database backup)**

```markdown
# Backup Command — Context

**Gathered:** 2025-01-20
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Feature Boundary

CLI command to backup database to local file or S3. Supports full and incremental backups. Restore command is a separate feature.

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Output format
- JSON for programmatic use, table format for humans
- Default to table, --json flag for JSON
- Verbose mode (-v) shows progress, silent by default

### Flag design
- Short flags for common options: -o (output), -v (verbose), -f (force)
- Long flags for clarity: --incremental, --compress, --encrypt
- Required: database connection string (positional or --db)

### Error recovery
- Retry 3 times on network failure, then fail with clear message
- --no-retry flag to fail fast
- Partial backups are deleted on failure (no corrupt files)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact progress bar implementation
- Compression algorithm choice
- Temp file handling

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "I want it to feel like pg_dump — familiar to database people"
- Should work in CI pipelines (exit codes, no interactive prompts)

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Scheduled backups — separate feature
- Backup rotation/retention — add to backlog

</deferred>

**Example 3: Organization task (Photo library)**

```markdown
# Photo Organization — Context

**Gathered:** 2025-01-20
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Feature Boundary

Organize existing photo library into structured folders. Handle duplicates and apply consistent naming. Tagging and search are separate features.

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Grouping criteria
- Primary grouping by year, then by month
- Events detected by time clustering (photos within 2 hours = same event)
- Event folders named by date + location if available

### Duplicate handling
- Keep highest resolution version
- Move duplicates to _duplicates folder (don't delete)
- Log all duplicate decisions for review

### Naming convention
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_originalname.ext
- Preserve original filename as suffix for searchability
- Handle name collisions with incrementing suffix

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact clustering algorithm
- How to handle photos with no EXIF data
- Folder emoji usage

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "I want to be able to find photos by roughly when they were taken"
- Don't delete anything — worst case, move to a review folder

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Face detection grouping — future feature
- Cloud sync — out of scope for now

</deferred>

<guidelines>
**This template captures DECISIONS from the discussion step.**

The output should answer: "What does the researcher need to investigate? What choices are locked for planning?"

**Good content (concrete decisions):**
- "Card-based layout, not timeline"
- "Retry 3 times on network failure, then fail"
- "Group by year, then by month"
- "JSON for programmatic use, table for humans"

**Bad content (too vague):**
- "Should feel modern and clean"
- "Good user experience"
- "Fast and responsive"
- "Easy to use"

**Sections explained:**

- **Domain** — The scope anchor. Copied/derived from ROADMAP.md. Fixed boundary.
- **Decisions** — Organized by areas discussed (NOT predefined categories). Section headers come from the actual discussion — "Layout style", "Flag design", "Grouping criteria", etc.
- **Claude's Discretion** — Explicit acknowledgment of what Claude can decide during implementation.
- **Specifics** — Product references, examples, "like X but..." statements.
- **Deferred** — Ideas captured but explicitly out of scope. Prevents scope creep while preserving good ideas.

**After creation:**
- File lives in feature directory: `.planning/features/{slug}/CONTEXT.md`
- Used by gsd-researcher to focus investigation
- Used during planning to create executable tasks
- Downstream steps should NOT need to ask the user again about captured decisions
</guidelines>
